Sheet contains n*n array of Nodes which will store consant numbers or formulas. I propose a method which solves the proble of updation of dependent nodes while updating any node. Here, address is refering to the name of the cell(node) i.e.: A1, A5, C4, H7, etc.

Node (each element in sheet):
Each node has : 
	Data, 
	a list which stores address of nodes which are dependent to this node (e.g.: for graph given in image 1, dependent nodes of Node 5 is Node 4 and 6)


After insertion or deletion of any node, call a method which will update dependencies.

to implement the function, we need a queue which stores the address of nodes.


Funciton insert or Update Element(Node i, Data d):
	If new value d is a function which is dependent on other Node, then we add address of node i to those parent nodes whose dependent is node i. 
Add node i to the queue
Call updateDependencies funciton. 


Function updateDependencies:
	Dequeue a node from queue and call it i.
	Check whether all the nodes where i is dependent are already updated or not. (This can either be done by a parallel matrix of same size, which stores boolean value whether the node is upadted or not or all nodes whos address is present in queque are nodes which are still not updated.)
	 If all nodes on which I is dependent are updated, then update the node, otherwise  enqueue i to the queue.
	Call updateDependencies till the queue becomes empty.
